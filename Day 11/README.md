# Day 11

## Theory
Day 11 comprises: 
- Coordinate Geometry, and solving problems with 2D coordinates
- In depth discussions about using Functions in PHP

> Problem of the Day (DSA):
> Q) Given step instructions(direction and magnitude), calculate distance travelled between Point A and Point B
> In: [[south, 8], [west, 10], [west, 63]]
> Out: Total distance: 73.437047870949 units
> In: [[east, 22], [east, 42], [north, 92], [south, 95], [south, 95]]
> Out: Total distance: 117.0469991072 units
